# Hi there

I'm Julia; I also go by Julie, or Jules.

I'm a marine ecologist championing kinder, better science in less time â€” for future us. My main focus is how open source, data science, and environmental research can empower us to uncover climate solutions faster by working together as inclusive teams and communities. I am an active part of the open science movement.
