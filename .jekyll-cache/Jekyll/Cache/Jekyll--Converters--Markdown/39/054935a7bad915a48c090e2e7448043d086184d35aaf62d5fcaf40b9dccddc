I"<p>I practice and promote open and reproducible science. This means being transparent about and sharing methods and tools used for scientific exploration and discovery. This way, workflows and results can be reproduced and built upon to advance our collective knowledge. Today, this also means using and contributing to free, online resources and sharing with the growing community. I teach open science concepts in part through <a href="http://ohi-science.org">OHI-Science</a>, UCSBâ€™s <a href="http://eco-data-science.github.io">eco-data-science</a>, and <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>. I also have an ongoing <a href="http://jules32.github.io/resources/open-science/">list of blogs about open science and open science tools</a>.</p>
