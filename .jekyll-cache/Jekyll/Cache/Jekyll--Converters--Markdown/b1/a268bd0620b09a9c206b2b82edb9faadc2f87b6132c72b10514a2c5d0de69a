I"P<p>I enjoy cooking and baking as an art, going off-recipe and exploring with different ingredients (almost always adding more chocolate than recommended). I also enjoy sewing and knitting, and learning other crafts with paper and wool. Most of these projects are for family (especially my nieces) and friends, and sometimes for me.</p>
