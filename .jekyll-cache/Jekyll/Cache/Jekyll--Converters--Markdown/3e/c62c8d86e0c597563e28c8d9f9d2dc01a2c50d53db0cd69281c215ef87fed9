I"5<p>My husband Elliot Lowndes is a wildlife cameraman and photographer; check out his work at <a href="http://mrlowndes.com">mrlowndes.com</a>. When we are off on adventures together, I practice my skills as an amateur grip, porter, and voice-activated light stand. And I take photos of him taking photos.</p>
