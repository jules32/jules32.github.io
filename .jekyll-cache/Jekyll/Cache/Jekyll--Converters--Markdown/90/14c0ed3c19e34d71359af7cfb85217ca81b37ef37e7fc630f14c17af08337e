I"]<p>I’ve always played team sports; I was a water polo goalie for ten years and started the UCLA Club Water Polo team in 2000 (which is still going strong!). Recently I’ve been learning the Lindy Hop, a swing dance from 1930’s Harlem. But my favorite is being outside hiking, running around, swimming, and having beers in beautiful places.</p>
