                    <p>Hi, I'm Julia, or Julie, or Jules.</p> 
                    <p>I am a marine data scientist and Mozilla Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), working to increase the value and practice of open environmental science. I am Founding Director of Openscapes, a mentorship program for early career environmental scientists in leadership roles, and Science Program Lead for the Ocean Health Index (OHI), bridging marine science, data science, and management. I am a co-founder of Eco-Data-Science and RLadies Santa Barbara, and I also lead trainings through OHI, NCEAS, Software Carpentry. I earned my PhD from Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate. </p>
