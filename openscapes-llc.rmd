Openscapes LLC strongly believes that open science plays a critical role in climate solutions and justice. As a member of 1% for the Planet, we donate at least 1% of revenue each year to environmental non-profits.

We joined 1% for the Planet in 2024, committing to donate at least 1% of all revenue to grassroots environmental nonprofits. We will prioritize our giving to address three key issue areas:

-   climate
-   conservation of public lands and waters
-   environmental justice
